This is a console utility, that was created to simplify the development of file parsing defaultpresets.xml , which stores the Josm presets.
To use it, you need to comment out the lines in the "OSM structures" file:

1. import GLMap
2. func getVectorObject()

The AppSettings class is an analogue of the singleton AppSettings mobile application.
